# Kimia-Farma-Performance-Analytics

## Background Problem
Kimia Farma, a leading pharmaceutical company in Indonesia, faces challenges managing and analyzing its operational data, which is distributed across multiple systems without full consolidation. This fragmentation hinders comprehensive evaluation of branch performance, sales trends, and customer satisfaction, limiting the company’s ability to conduct data-driven strategic planning.

The project aims to analyze Kimia Farma’s business performance from 2020 to 2023, focusing on key metrics such as transaction volume, revenue, profit, and customer ratings. By leveraging data analytics, this project helps uncover business insights that can support operational improvements and strategic decision-making.


## Tools & Libraries
This project utilizes the following tools to handle and visualize Kimia Farma’s big data:
* **Google BigQuery** – for large-scale data storage, preparation, and advanced querying.
* **Google Looker Studio** – for interactive dashboard creation and data visualization.


## Insights
The analysis revealed several important business insights:
* **Stable yet stagnant sales and profit trends**: Kimia Farma’s net sales hover around Rp80 billion annually with minor fluctuations, peaking in 2022 but slightly declining again in 2023. Profit margins remain stable at around 28% without significant growth.
* **Geographical performance concentration**: West Java province dominates as the top contributor, accounting for nearly 30% of total net sales and transaction volume. However, regions like East Java and East Kalimantan experienced notable sales and transaction declines, signaling a need for focused investigation.
* **High growth provinces**: West Nusa Tenggara showed positive growth in both sales (+2.6%) and transactions (+2.2%) in 2023, indicating potential areas for expansion.
* **Product performance**: Psycholeptics, hypnotics, and anxiolytic drugs are the best-selling product categories with high profit margins, representing a strategic opportunity for focused marketing and sales efforts.
* **Customer satisfaction anomalies**: Branches such as Sorong, Cikampek, and Kupang have high branch ratings (>4.5), but transaction ratings remain flat around 4.0, suggesting issues in transaction service quality, possibly related to stock availability, payment systems, or return processes.
* **Profit distribution imbalance**: The bulk of profits are concentrated in western Indonesia, especially on Java island, with eastern regions contributing only about 20%, highlighting regional market dependency risks.

## Advices
Based on the findings, the following steps are recommended to improve Kimia Farma’s performance:
* Conduct audits on stock and pricing in underperforming provinces like East Java and East Kalimantan to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks.
* Develop bundled offers and upselling strategies for high-margin psycholeptics product lines to maximize revenue.
* Enhance customer experience at high-rated branches with stagnant transaction ratings through staff training and refinement of transaction systems.
* Expand market presence in Eastern Indonesia by investing in logistics infrastructure and optimizing the pharmaceutical supply chain.
* Replicate successful sales strategies from West Java in provinces with positive sales and transaction growth, such as West Nusa Tenggara.
